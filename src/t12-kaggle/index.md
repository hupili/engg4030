# Supervised Learning

We will practice supervised learning with an example competition from [Kaggle](http://www.kaggle.com/).
The [Titanic survival prediction](http://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic-gettingStarted/) 
is a getting started competition on Kaggle.

## Preparation

Download the `train.csv` and `test.csv` from Kaggle.
Put the two files under current directory with those IPython Notebooks.

## IPython Notebooks

   * Preparation and Basic Statistics:
   [online viwer]({{site.nbviewer_prefix}}/t12-kaggle/Preparation-and-Basic-Statistics.ipynb),
   [source](Preparation-and-Basic-Statistics.ipynb)
   * Supervised Learning:
   [online viwer]({{site.nbviewer_prefix}}/t12-kaggle/Supervised-Learning.ipynb),
   [source](Supervised-Learning.ipynb)

## Outcome of This Tutorial

   * Have a feel of what a data mining competition looks like in real life.
   Participating in those competitions is a good way to sharpen your skills and learn new things in the future.
   * Build up the concept of supervised learning.
   Can recognize and transform real world problems into classification or regression format.

## Outcome of Whole Tutorial Series and Homeworks

   * Get to know state-of-the-art systems, platforms and workflows.
   * Not afraid of self-learning any new algorithms and tools for data mining.
