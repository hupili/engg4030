# K-Means Clustering

See the IPython Notebook:

   * Clustering:
   [online viwer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/course.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/~engg4030/tutorial/tutorial6/Clustering.ipynb),
   [source](https://course.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/~engg4030/tutorial/tutorial6/Clustering.ipynb)

## Outcome

   * Further familiarize with IPython environment
   and scientific computation libraries in Python.
   * Practice K-means.
   In practice, you may simply find a clustering package.
   In this tutorial, you are asked to Understanding the internals.
   * Practice incremental K-means.
   The mergeability is foundation of streaming or parallel version of K-means.
