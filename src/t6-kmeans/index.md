# K-Means Clustering

## IPython Notebook

See the IPython Notebook:

   * Clustering:
   [online viwer]({{site.nbviewer_prefix}}/t6-kmeans/Clustering.ipynb),
   [source](Clustering.ipynb)

## Outcome of This Tutorial

   * Further familiarize with IPython environment
   and scientific computation libraries in Python.
   * Practice K-means.
   In practice, you may simply find a clustering package.
   In this tutorial, you are asked to Understanding the internals.
   * Practice incremental K-means.
   The mergeability is foundation of streaming or parallel version of K-means.
